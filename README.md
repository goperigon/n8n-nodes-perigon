## Advanced Features

### Boolean Search Syntax

Many search fields support advanced Boolean operators for precise querying:

- **AND**: Both terms must be present (e.g., `climate AND policy`)
- **OR**: Either term can be present (e.g., `Biden OR Trump`)
- **NOT**: Exclude terms (e.g., `energy NOT fossil`)
- **Wildcards**: Use `*` for multiple characters, `?` for single character (e.g., `climat*`, `wom?n`)
- **Grouping**: Use parentheses to group terms (e.g., `(renewable OR clean) AND energy`)
- **Exact Phrases**: Use double quotes for exact matching (e.g., `"climate change"`)

**Example Complex Query:**

```
("artificial intelligence" OR AI OR "machine learning") AND (healthcare OR medical) NOT cryptocurrency
```

### Semantic Vector Search

Both Article and Wikipedia resources support vector search for semantic similarity matching:

- Use natural language queries instead of keywords
- Find conceptually related content even without exact keyword matches
- Ideal for AI/LLM workflows and exploratory research
- Better results for complex, multi-faceted queries
